# Arch7z Installer (Xray_OS)

## üöß Note:
Arch7z Installer is in **beta**. Expect bugs and maybe some limitations. Proceed with caution.

---

## üöÄ Overview

Arch7z Installer replaces Calamares for Xray_OS with a lightweight, Qt-based installer written in C++. It focuses on speed, simplicity, and a clean user experience for both real hardware and virtual machines.

---

## Key Features

- Fast C++/Qt implementation  
- Simple, step-by-step UI  
- Full locale configuration:
  - Language  
  - Region  
  - Timezone  
  - Keyboard layout and variant with live testing  
- Two installation modes:
  - Clean Install (wipes target disk)  
  - Custom Install (manual partitioning via built-in options and GParted)  
- Filesystem support: EXT4 or BTRFS  
- VM-friendly single-partition layout  

---

## Installation Modes

### Clean Install

1. Select the target disk.  
2. Installer automatically partitions EFI/boot and root.  
3. Choose filesystem (EXT4 or BTRFS).  
4. Proceed with installation.  

### Custom Install

1. Launch GParted from within the installer to modify partitions.  
2. Click **Refresh** to reload your changes.  
3. Assign partitions for:
   - EFI/boot (required)  
   - root `/` (required)  
   - swap (optional)  
4. Select filesystem types.  
5. Continue with installation.

when it comes to **VMs** at least in Virtual Box, (theres problems with Virt Manager), Arch7Z installer changes the partition Layout for a single partition to install the whole system, without the swap option. You have the options between EXT4 and BTRFS as a file system for all modes, Clean and Custom install options on real Hardware and also for VMs.

---

## User Configuration

On the final screen, set up your system user and defaults:

- Hostname (default: `Xray_OS`)  
- Username and password  
- Optionally use the same password for root or set a separate one  
- Shell choice: Fish (default), Bash, or Zsh
